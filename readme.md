# Jennifer
###### An open source virtual Assistant (Only OSX is supported)
> For those wondering why the first commit is so monolithic, it's because I erased the git history after removing a feature due to a cease and disist order. (Hitting a private API)

Inspired by [Jasper Client](https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client) but built from scratch to be smarter and
more powerful.

## :checkered_flag: Goals & Reasons for building Jennifer
- *MUCH* Less coupling between the brain & the client interface
- Easier plugin interface
- Better security between plugins
- Simpler API
- More efficient brain
- Everything is testable

## :floppy_disk: Installation
Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:androbwebb/JenniferVirtualAssistant.git`

CD into the folder `cd JenniferVirtualAssistant`

Make sure you're using python 3.6+

```
python --version
Python 3.7.6
```

Install Dependencies (Needs to be done every time a plugin is added) `python install_requirements.py`

Run a test client with `python quick_run.py`


## :speech_balloon: Responding Modules:
Active modules that are triggered by input

| **Fandango** | (Planned) | Find out when movies are playing near you |



## :ear: Notification Modules
Passive modules that act similar to push notifications

|      Name      |   Status   |         Description        |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **GMail** | [Here](https://github.com/androbwebb/JenniferVirtualAssistant/tree/master/lessons/JenniferGmailPlugin) | Jennifer will alert you when you have new gmail notifications. |
| **Instagram** | (In dev) | Alert you of new instagram notifications |
| **Facebook** | (In dev) | Jennifer will alert you when you have new facebook notifications. |
| **CouchPotato** | (Planned) | Jennifer will alert you when new movies are downloaded with couch potato. |
| **Alarm** | (Planned) | Jennifer can act as your alarm clock. |
| **Slack** | (Planned) | Read slack messages outloud |
| **Pushover** | (Planned) | A proxy to receive notifications as a [Pushover Open Client](https://pushover.net/api/client) and pass them through to Jennifer |


## :computer: Clients
IO sources, various ways of interacting with Jennifer

| Client | Status | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| **Terminal** | Done | Interact with Jennifer via a text-based command line prompt |
| **iPhone**  | (Planned) | Interact with Jennifer via STT in an iPhone app. |
| **Google STT**  | (Planned) | Interact with Jennifer via any device you can install Google STT on (rPi, Mac OSX) |

## :mailbox_with_mail: Major Todos:
- [ ] Respect quiet hours for notifications
- [ ] Bite the bullet and make an actual client with STT
- [ ] Make a music-based plugin
- [ ] Use a response type other than JenniferReponseTextSegment

## :cool: Smaller Todos:
- [ ] Make a news plugin (or something that is actually interesting)
- [ ] Make an alarm clock
- [ ] Think about how this would play into hardware (Tie a button to alarm clock?)
- [ ] Control Plex?

# :dancers: Contributing:
I welcome all contributions as long as they adhere to the principals listed in the [Goals](https://github.com/androbwebb/JenniferVirtualAssistant#checkered_flag-goals--reasons-for-building-jennifer) section. If you contribute a client or plugin, expect to be tagged in future PR's that affect your code.

# :ledger: API Guide

## Overview
Jennifer is a `brain` and `clients`. The `brain` does processing of input and returns output. `client`s are
responsible for all IO. A client can be any type and combination of input and output. Imagine Amazon's Alexa: it has
microphone input and speaker output. I didn't want to lock Jennifer to only audible IO however. Included in this package
is a terminal-based client for pure text input and output. You could also connect a raspberry PI to a screen, and show
only output in visual formats.

### Lessons (Plugins)
A `lesson` is a set of related functionality that extends the capability of the `brain` to complete some tasks.
For example, `JenniferGmailPlugin` brings 3 functions:

1. Count the number of unread emails in GMail account
2. Read my unread emails outloud
3. Notify me when I have new emails



|      Type    |             Class            |  Description  |
|:------------:|:----------------------------:| ------------- |
|    Response  |   `JenniferResponsePlugin`   | A plugin that responds when triggered by a set of commands: examples: `JenniferTimePlugin`, `JenniferFindMyIphonePlugin`)
| Notification | `JenniferNotificationPlugin` | A wrapper for a background task. Upon initiation, creates a task that runs on an interval or at a specified time. Examples: `JenniferGmailNotificationPlugin`

#### ResponsePlugin
All response plugins must implement at least three things:

- `VERBOSE_NAME` property must be set with a short description of what it does. For example, `JenniferTimePlugin` would have `VERBOSE_NAME = 'Tell the time or date'`
- `can_respond(**kwargs)` must return a boolean indicating if the plugin wants control. kwarg specifics below
- `respond(**kwargs)` should run the commands. kwarg specifics below. You can call `client.give_output` (or the shortcut `client.give_output_string`) for output, but don't `return` unless you are ready for the plugin to give up control.

| kwarg | Info |
| --- | --- |
| `tags` | a set of [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) parsed tags. Each word is matched with it's best guess part of speech.|
| `plain_text` | the plain text that was given from the client |
| `client`|- the client currently running. |
| `brain` | the brain. likely won't be used.. might be deprecated later. |
